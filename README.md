# How to use it
## Step-by-step installation.
1. Create an empty private repository on GitHub where project deployments will be stored and controlled.
    
    - This step will only be done the first time, since it is not necessary afterwards.
    - It is very important that you know that every time you create a new project, the repository must also be new.

2. Get the project.

    ##### USE THE OPTION YOU WANT TO GET THE PROJECT
    
    ---
    
    ###### OPTION 1 - GET FROM COMPOSER
    
    > Go to where you want to create the project.
    
    ```sh
    #> cd C:\Users\User\Documents
    ```
    
    > Create project using composer.
    
    ```sh
    #> composer create-project jhoncytech/automated-deployment my-web
    ```
    
    > Go to new created directory.
    
    ```sh
    #> cd my-web
    ```
    ---
    
    ###### OPTION 2 - GET FROM GITHUB REPOSITORY
    
    > Go to where you want to create the project.
    
    ```sh
    #> cd C:\Users\User\Documents
    ```
    
    > Create a directory on your pc where the entire project will be managed.
    
    ```sh
    #> mkdir my-web
    ```
    
    > Go to new created directory.
    
    ```sh
    #> cd my-web
    ```
    
    > Clone from GitHub the Automated Vagrant Deployment project by JhonnyGO.
    
    ```sh
    #> git clone git@github.com:jhonnygo/automated-deployment.git .
    ```

3.  Edit the project **[Vagrantfile]** file.

    This file is located in the folder `C:\Users\User\Documents\my-web\Vagrantfile`
    
    It's very important that you edit the following mandatory parameters:
    
    * `config.vm.hostname = "my-web"` => Name of the host you want for your local server
    * `config.vm.network = "192.168.10.10` => Private IP you want for your local server
    * `vb.name = "local-my-web"`  => Machine name for Virtualbox
    
    There are more optional values, feel free to modify them according to your needs.
    
---
    
4.  Edit the **[00-shell-script-config.sh]** file

    This file is located in the folder `C:\Users\User\Documents\my-web\config\scripts\00-shell-script-config.sh`
    
    It's very important that you edit the following mandatory parameters:
    
    * `REMOTE_IP=""` It must be a public IP, since it is the IP of the remote server.
    * `LOCAL_IP="192.168.10.10"` It must be a private IP which is the IP of the local server used in Vagrantfile file.
    * `GIT_USER_NAME="Jeff Smith"` GitHub user who will perform the commits.
    * `GIT_USER_EMAIL="jeff.smith@gmail.com"` Email of the GitHub user who will perform the commits.
    * `REPO_GITHUB_HTML=""` URL in SSH format of the GitHub repository where the deployments will be made.
    
    NOTE: Remember that if you not indicated some password that password will be generated automatically.
    
---
    
5.  Create the SSH key pair to work with the project repository.

    > Go to following folder of the SSH project Keys: **[ssh-keys]**
    
    ```
    #> cd C:\Users\User\Documents\wy-web\config\ssh-keys
    #> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my-web-local"
    ```
    * Use as name: `ssh-key-local-test`
    * Keep password empty:
    
    The above command will create your SSH key pair.
    
    IMPORTANT: If you already have your own key pair, you can copy and paste them into this directory.
    
---
    
6.  Add the public key of your local server **[ssh-key-local-test.pub]** on the remote server so that the local server can communicate with the remote one.

    > In local server
    
    ```
    #> cd C:\Users\User\Documents\wy-web\config\ssh-keys
    #> cat ssh-key-local-test.pub
    ```

    > In remote server
    
    ```
    #> nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    copy your local server's public key **[ssh-key-local-test.pub]** at the end of the file.
    
7.  Add the public key of your local server **[ssh-key-local-test.pub]** to the GitHub account that I created earlier.

---

8.  Now, Its time to starts the project.

    > In remote server
    
    ```
    #> cd C:\Users\User\Documents\wy-web
    #> vagrant up
    ```
    
---
